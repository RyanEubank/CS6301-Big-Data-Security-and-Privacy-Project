# Inference-Module
This project module implements a simple tool to reconstruct data from statistics gathered from the original dataset.
Records are reconstructed step by step from each piece of additional information and quick explanations are provided
to show how inference attacks use statistics to infer the original data.

## Run the program
Use the following command to run the inference tool
```
./run.bat --inference
```
No arguments are required, the program will request user input for specific statistics.
In all cases simply input the requested number and press enter.
