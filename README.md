# CS6301-Big-Data-Security-and-Privacy-Project
This project implements several tools related to data privacy and statistics.
There are 4 modules that use a [fake dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset) as an example for implementing differencial privacy (DP) - see the wikipedia entry for DP [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy). The modules are as follows:

* [Statistics](statistics)
* [Inference Attacks](inference)
* [Differentially Private Statistics](dp)

The project root directory includes a windows batch script to compile and run each module as a command line tool. Detailed descriptions for each are provided in their respective directories.
